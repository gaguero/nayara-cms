# Task ID: 19
# Title: Configure Custom Domains for Deployed Services
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 17, 18
# Priority: low
# Description: Set up custom domains for the deployed backend (Railway) and frontend (Vercel) services to provide a professional and branded user experience.
# Details:
This task involves configuring custom domains for both the backend and frontend services:

**Backend (Railway) Configuration:**
1. Access the Railway dashboard and navigate to the deployed backend project
2. Go to the 'Settings' or 'Domains' section
3. Add the desired custom domain (e.g., api.yourapp.com)
4. Note the provided DNS records that need to be configured (typically a CNAME record)
5. Configure SSL/TLS certificates for the domain

**Frontend (Vercel) Configuration:**
1. Access the Vercel dashboard and select the deployed frontend project
2. Navigate to the 'Domains' section
3. Add the desired custom domain (e.g., yourapp.com or www.yourapp.com)
4. Note the provided DNS records that need to be configured
5. Ensure SSL/TLS is properly configured

**DNS Configuration:**
1. Access your domain registrar or DNS provider's dashboard
2. Add the required DNS records for both services:
   - For Railway: Typically a CNAME record pointing to the provided Railway URL
   - For Vercel: Typically a CNAME record for www subdomain and an A record for the apex domain
3. Set appropriate TTL values (Time To Live)

**Application Configuration:**
1. Update any hardcoded URLs in the application to use the new custom domains
2. Update CORS settings in the backend to allow requests from the new frontend domain
3. Update environment variables in both services if necessary

Note: DNS propagation may take up to 48 hours, though it's often much faster.

# Test Strategy:
**Testing Strategy:**

1. **DNS Propagation Verification:**
   - Use tools like `dig`, `nslookup`, or online DNS lookup services to verify DNS records are correctly configured
   - Check that the records point to the correct Railway and Vercel servers

2. **Domain Accessibility Testing:**
   - Verify that both domains (frontend and backend) are accessible via web browsers
   - Ensure that HTTPS is working correctly with valid SSL certificates (check for the lock icon in browsers)
   - Test both www and non-www versions of the domain if applicable

3. **API Functionality Testing:**
   - Test API endpoints using the new custom domain
   - Verify that API requests from the frontend to the backend work correctly
   - Test with tools like Postman or curl to ensure the backend responds properly

4. **Cross-Origin Testing:**
   - Verify that CORS is properly configured by making requests from the frontend to the backend
   - Check browser console for any CORS-related errors

5. **Environment Variable Verification:**
   - Verify that all environment variables referencing domains have been updated
   - Test any features that rely on absolute URLs

6. **Browser Compatibility:**
   - Test the custom domains on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Test on both desktop and mobile devices

7. **Performance Check:**
   - Run a basic performance test to ensure the domain configuration doesn't introduce latency
   - Use tools like Lighthouse or PageSpeed Insights to verify performance
