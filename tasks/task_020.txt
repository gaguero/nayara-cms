# Task ID: 20
# Title: Document Deployment Process in deployment.md
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 17, 18, 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive documentation of the entire deployment process in a new memory-bank/deployment.md file, covering all platforms, commands, configurations, and step sequences.
# Details:
Create a new file at memory-bank/deployment.md that thoroughly documents the entire deployment process. The documentation should include:

1. **Platform Overview**:
   - Description of Railway (backend) and Vercel (frontend) platforms
   - Rationale for platform selection
   - Account setup instructions

2. **Backend Deployment (Railway)**:
   - CLI commands used for deployment
   - Project setup and configuration steps
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Database setup and migration process
   - Monitoring and logging setup

3. **Frontend Deployment (Vercel)**:
   - Build process and commands
   - Project configuration details
   - Environment variable setup
   - Integration with the backend

4. **Domain Configuration**:
   - Custom domain setup for both platforms
   - DNS configuration steps
   - SSL/TLS certificate setup

5. **Deployment Sequence**:
   - Step-by-step deployment workflow
   - Order of operations
   - Dependencies between deployment steps

6. **Troubleshooting**:
   - Common issues and their solutions
   - Debugging techniques

7. **Maintenance Procedures**:
   - Update/upgrade process
   - Backup procedures

Use Markdown formatting with clear headings, code blocks for commands, and tables where appropriate. Include screenshots of critical configuration screens if helpful.

# Test Strategy:
To verify this task has been completed correctly:

1. **Document Existence and Location**:
   - Confirm the deployment.md file exists in the memory-bank directory
   - Verify the file uses proper Markdown syntax and formatting

2. **Content Completeness**:
   - Check that all seven sections listed in the details are present and comprehensive
   - Verify all CLI commands are accurate by testing a sample of them
   - Ensure environment variable documentation is complete but does not expose sensitive information

3. **Accuracy Verification**:
   - Have another team member follow the documentation to perform a test deployment to staging environments
   - Identify and correct any steps that are unclear or missing

4. **Cross-Reference**:
   - Compare the documentation against the actual deployed systems to ensure alignment
   - Verify that any platform-specific details match current platform versions

5. **Readability Assessment**:
   - Have a team member unfamiliar with the deployment process review the document for clarity
   - Ensure technical terms are explained or linked to relevant resources
