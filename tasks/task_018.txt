# Task ID: 18
# Title: Deploy React Frontend to Vercel
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16, 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure and deploy the React frontend application to Vercel, ensuring proper connection to the production backend API.
# Details:
This task involves deploying the React frontend to Vercel's hosting platform. The developer should:

1. Install the Vercel CLI globally using npm: `npm install -g vercel`
2. Navigate to the frontend project directory
3. Login to Vercel via the CLI: `vercel login`
4. Initialize the Vercel project: `vercel init`
5. Link the local project to the Vercel project: `vercel link`
6. Configure environment variables in the Vercel project settings:
   - Set `REACT_APP_API_URL` (or equivalent) to point to the production backend URL
   - Ensure any other required environment variables are set
7. Deploy the project to production: `vercel --prod`
8. Note the deployment URL provided by Vercel
9. Update any necessary documentation with the new frontend URL
10. If using a custom domain, configure it in the Vercel dashboard
11. Ensure proper CORS settings are configured on the backend to allow requests from the Vercel domain

# Test Strategy:
To verify successful deployment:

1. Visit the deployed Vercel URL and confirm the application loads correctly
2. Test all major functionality to ensure it works with the production backend:
   - User authentication (login/signup)
   - Data fetching from the backend API
   - Form submissions and data persistence
3. Test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) to ensure cross-browser compatibility
4. Test on mobile devices to verify responsive design
5. Check network requests in browser developer tools to confirm they're hitting the correct production API endpoints
6. Verify that environment variables are correctly applied by examining network requests
7. Run Lighthouse or similar performance tests on the deployed site
8. Check for any console errors that might indicate configuration issues
9. Verify that the deployment is using HTTPS
10. Have another team member independently verify the deployment works from a different network/location
