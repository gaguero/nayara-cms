# Priority: high
# Description: Create the campaign provider and campaign selector component to manage the active campaign context.

2. Implement campaign state management with:
   - availableCampaigns (array of {id, name})
   - activeCampaignId (string | null)
   - isLoadingCampaigns flag
3. Fetch campaigns using react-query upon successful authentication
4. Persist activeCampaignId to localStorage
5. Set default active campaign if none selected
6. Create useCampaign hook to access campaign context
7. Implement CampaignSelector component in src/components/campaign/CampaignSelector.tsx using Shadcn Select or DropdownMenu
