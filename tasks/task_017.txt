# Task ID: 17
# Title: Deploy Backend Infrastructure to Railway
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up and deploy the NestJS backend, PostgreSQL database, and storage volume to Railway cloud platform using Railway CLI and web interface.
# Details:
This task involves deploying our application infrastructure to Railway cloud platform. Follow these steps:

1. Install Railway CLI: `npm install -g @railway/cli`

2. Login to Railway: `railway login`

3. Initialize a new Railway project: `railway init`

4. Set up PostgreSQL service:
   - Add a PostgreSQL service: `railway add`
   - Select PostgreSQL from the options
   - Note the connection string for later use

5. Deploy NestJS backend:
   - Navigate to the backend directory
   - Link to Railway project: `railway link`
   - Configure environment variables:
     - DATABASE_URL (from PostgreSQL service)
     - JWT_SECRET
     - Other required environment variables
   - Deploy the service: `railway up`

6. Set up persistent storage volume:
   - Create a volume via Railway dashboard
   - Attach the volume to the NestJS service
   - Configure the mount path in service settings

7. Configure domain and HTTPS:
   - Generate a custom domain in Railway dashboard
   - Ensure HTTPS is enabled

8. Set up continuous deployment:
   - Connect Railway to the GitHub repository
   - Configure automatic deployments for the main branch

9. Monitor the deployment and check logs for any issues

10. Document all service URLs, connection strings, and configuration details in the project documentation.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the deployment with the following tests:

1. API Endpoint Testing:
   - Use Postman or curl to test key API endpoints
   - Verify that all endpoints return expected responses
   - Test authentication flows with JWT tokens

2. Database Connection:
   - Confirm the backend can connect to PostgreSQL
   - Run a simple query to verify data persistence
   - Test database migrations if applicable

3. Storage Volume:
   - Upload a test file to verify storage functionality
   - Confirm the file persists after service restarts

4. Environment Variables:
   - Verify all environment variables are correctly set
   - Test that sensitive information is properly secured

5. Performance Check:
   - Measure response times for critical endpoints
   - Ensure they meet performance requirements

6. Error Handling:
   - Intentionally trigger errors to verify proper error responses
   - Check that errors are properly logged

7. Continuous Deployment:
   - Make a small change to the codebase
   - Push to the main branch
   - Verify automatic deployment occurs

8. Documentation:
   - Ensure all deployment details are documented
   - Include troubleshooting steps for common issues

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up Railway CLI and initialize project [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install Railway CLI, authenticate, and create a new Railway project for the application deployment
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Install Railway CLI globally using npm: `npm install -g @railway/cli`
2. Authenticate with Railway account: `railway login` (this will open a browser window for authentication)
3. Initialize a new Railway project: `railway login`
4. Verify successful initialization by checking if a `.railway` directory was created
5. Document the project ID and other relevant information

Testing approach:
- Verify CLI installation by running `railway --version`
- Confirm successful login by running `railway whoami`
- Ensure project initialization was successful by checking if the project appears in the Railway dashboard

## 2. Provision and configure PostgreSQL database [done]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Set up a PostgreSQL database service in Railway and obtain connection credentials
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Add a PostgreSQL service to the project: `railway add`
2. Select PostgreSQL from the available service options
3. Wait for the service to be provisioned
4. Retrieve the database connection string: `railway variables get DATABASE_URL`
5. Save the connection string securely for use in the backend deployment
6. Configure any database-specific settings through the Railway dashboard (if needed)

Testing approach:
- Verify the PostgreSQL service is running in the Railway dashboard
- Test the connection string with a simple database client
- Run a basic query to confirm database accessibility

## 3. Deploy NestJS backend to Railway [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.2
### Description: Configure and deploy the NestJS backend application to Railway with proper environment variables
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Navigate to the backend directory in the project
2. Link the directory to the Railway project: `railway link`
3. Configure required environment variables:
   - Set DATABASE_URL: `railway variables set DATABASE_URL=<connection-string-from-subtask-2>`
   - Set JWT_SECRET: `railway variables set JWT_SECRET=<secure-random-string>`
   - Set any other required environment variables for the application
4. Deploy the backend service: `railway up`
5. Monitor the deployment logs for any errors
6. Note the service URL provided after successful deployment

Testing approach:
- Monitor deployment logs for successful build and startup
- Test basic API endpoints to verify the service is running correctly
- Check environment variables are correctly set using Railway dashboard

## 4. Set up persistent storage volume [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.3
### Description: Create and attach a persistent storage volume to the NestJS service for file storage
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Access the Railway dashboard in a web browser
2. Navigate to the project and select the NestJS service
3. Go to the 'Volumes' tab and create a new volume
4. Specify an appropriate size for the volume (e.g., 1GB)
5. Configure the mount path (e.g., `/app/uploads` or as required by the application)
6. Save the volume configuration
7. Restart the service to apply the volume attachment: `railway service restart`
8. Verify the volume is correctly mounted

Testing approach:
- Check service logs to confirm volume mounting
- Test file upload functionality in the application
- Verify files persist after service restarts

## 5. Configure domain, HTTPS, and continuous deployment [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.3, 17.4
### Description: Set up custom domain, HTTPS, and configure GitHub integration for continuous deployment
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. In the Railway dashboard, navigate to the NestJS service settings
2. Generate a custom domain for the service
3. Ensure HTTPS is enabled for the domain
4. Connect Railway to the GitHub repository:
   - Go to project settings
   - Select 'GitHub' integration
   - Authorize Railway to access the repository
   - Select the repository containing the NestJS backend
5. Configure automatic deployments:
   - Specify the main branch for deployment
   - Configure build settings if necessary
6. Document all service URLs, connection details, and configuration in the project documentation
7. Test the CI/CD pipeline by making a small change to the repository

Testing approach:
- Verify the custom domain resolves to the application
- Confirm HTTPS is working by checking the certificate
- Test the CI/CD pipeline by pushing a change and verifying automatic deployment
- Create comprehensive documentation with all access details
