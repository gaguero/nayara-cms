      "taskTitle": "Prepare Frontend and Backend for Production Deployment",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Prepare Frontend and Backend for Production Deployment' task into 6 specific subtasks that separate backend security configuration, frontend optimization, environment variable setup, error handling implementation, documentation creation, and final verification steps. For each subtask, include specific acceptance criteria and testing requirements.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to its dual focus on both frontend and backend systems, with multiple security considerations, environment configurations, and technical requirements for each. The task already contains natural groupings that can be formalized into subtasks."

      "taskTitle": "Deploy Backend Infrastructure to Railway",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Deploy Backend Infrastructure to Railway' task into 5 logical subtasks covering: initial Railway setup and authentication, PostgreSQL database configuration, NestJS backend deployment with environment variables, storage volume setup, and domain/HTTPS configuration with monitoring. Each subtask should include verification steps to ensure successful completion.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technical steps across different services (PostgreSQL, NestJS, storage volumes) on the Railway platform. It requires careful sequencing and configuration of environment variables, making it moderately complex but already well-structured in the description."

      "taskTitle": "Deploy React Frontend to Vercel",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the 'Deploy React Frontend to Vercel' task into 4 subtasks that cover: Vercel CLI setup and authentication, environment variable configuration, deployment execution and verification, and CORS/backend integration confirmation. Each subtask should include specific commands and expected outcomes.",
      "reasoning": "While less complex than the backend deployment, this task still requires multiple configuration steps, environment variable setup, and integration with the backend. The linear nature of the deployment process makes it moderately complex but straightforward to divide into logical phases."
    },

      "taskId": 19,
      "taskTitle": "Configure Custom Domains for Deployed Services",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Configure Custom Domains for Deployed Services' task into 4 subtasks covering: Railway backend domain configuration, Vercel frontend domain setup, DNS record configuration at the registrar level, and verification/testing of the custom domains with application updates. Include specific steps for SSL certificate verification.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves configuration across multiple platforms (Railway, Vercel, and DNS provider) but follows standard patterns for domain setup. The complexity comes from coordinating changes across different systems and waiting for DNS propagation, but the technical steps are relatively straightforward."

    {
      "taskId": 20,
      "taskTitle": "Document Deployment Process in deployment.md",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the 'Document Deployment Process in deployment.md' task into 5 subtasks focusing on: documenting platform overview and account setup, backend deployment procedures, frontend deployment procedures, domain configuration steps, and maintenance/troubleshooting guides. Each subtask should specify the exact sections to be written with formatting requirements.",
      "reasoning": "While primarily a documentation task, the complexity comes from needing to comprehensively understand and accurately document multiple technical processes across different platforms. The task requires organizing information logically and ensuring all deployment scenarios are covered, making it moderately complex."
